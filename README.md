# Soundscape

Welcome to Soundscape! In this game, your goal is to color the landscape of this barren city with music, by jumping from building to building. This README will explain how to set up and run this game, and how to start playing.

## Installing

If you have this file downloaded, you should have everything you need to get started. If you're seeing this on github, download the whole repository as a zip, and unzip into a folder on your computer. Make sure you have 3 .py files in your folder (main, physics, graphics_and_music), as well as 3 folders (common, data, and docs).

## Running

To run the game, open the soundscape directory in your terminal and run main.py (don't forget to activate conda!).

## Playing

After running main.py, you should be on an intro screen. You can click on either of the buttons on screen. A quick description of the controls is found on the instructions screen, but we will describe them here in more detail:

In this game, you need to jump from building to building in time with the music. There are markers on the buildings that show you where to jump, with the line in the center being the perfect time.

When the next building is above your current building, press [w] to jump up. When the next building is below your current building, press [s] to jump down. When the next building is at the same height as your current building, press [d] to jump across. Pressing the wrong button will reset your combo, and can even cause you to crash into the side of a building and lose a life! Once you're out of lives, you die and must restart to finish the level. Press [p] to pause during the game and press [r] to restart at any time!

There are also power-ups available! Press [y] to slow down the song so it's easier to play, [u] to flatten all of the buildings to the same level, and [i] to speed up the song and get an extra life. These abilities are on a cooldown, so be strategic with how you use them!

Once you're ready to play, go back to the intro screen and hit Start. Feel free to try the tutorial first, or jump straight into the first level. Best of luck!
